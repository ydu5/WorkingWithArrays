<p class="note">Here is the output of that variable:
  <i><%= @varaible_for_view %></i>
  </p>
<p class="note">Here, the output of that variable is suppressed because there is no '=': <% @varaible_for_view %></p>


<p>If you want to loop in an ERB file, check the source code for this file (views/index.erb)</p>
<ul>
  <% @people.each do | person | %>
    <li><%= person %></li>
  <% end %>
</ul>

<ol>
  <li>Open the run.rb file in your text editor</li>
  <li>Follow the instructions for each step in the Readm.md file.</li>
  <li>When looping through the array of states for the final step, you will use &lt;% %> and &lt;%= %> (the = means that content will be written to the screen).</li>


  <li>Once you have completed all steps and are ready to turn the assignment in:
    <ol>
      <li>Make sure you add the files to your working copy with git add .</li>
      <li>Commit your work using git commit -am 'your commit message'</li>
